            <p>
              Founded in 2023 by <em>Hitesh Kandare</em>, SweetBites Bakery has
              come a long way from its beginnings in a small kitchen. When
              Hitesh first started out, her passion for baking drove her to
              start her own business, and we are thrilled that we're able to
              turn our passion into our own website.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them
              to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't
              hesitate to contact us.
            </p>
            <p class="signature">Sincerely,<br />Hitesh Kandare, Founder</p>
